# Streaming GTCRN
The streaming conversion method used here is consistent with the streaming conversion in the [TRT-SE](https://github.com/Xiaobin-Rong/TRT-SE) repository. However, we only deploy it using ONNX and perform inference on the CPU, thanks to the ultra-low complexity of GTCRN.

## Acknowledgement
I would like to express my gratitude to [Linghao Yu](https://github.com/SherryYu33) for resolving a bug in simplifying the `gtcrn.onnx` file. More details can be found in [issue-3](https://github.com/Xiaobin-Rong/gtcrn/issues/3).
